We are thrilled to announce the release of rtflite 1.0.0, 
marking a significant milestone in bringing production-ready 
TLF generation capabilities in RTF format to Python for clinical trial reporting. 
This major release represents our commitment to providing the pharmaceutical industry with robust, reliable tools for creating tables, listings, and figures (TLFs) in RTF format.

## What is rtflite?

[rtflite](https://pharmaverse.github.io/rtflite/) is a Python package 
designed specifically for generating TLFs in RTF format for clinical trial reporting. 
Inspired by the [r2rtf](https://merck.github.io/r2rtf/) R package, 
it provides a programmatic interface to create highly customized TLFs that meet regulatory submission requirements. 
With [pkglite](https://pharmaverse.github.io/py-pkglite/), [rtflite](https://pharmaverse.github.io/rtflite/) bridges 
the gap between Python's data science ecosystem and the specific needs in clinical trial reporting and submission.

## Major Enhancements in 1.0.0

### Pagination Capabilities

With the `page_by`, `group_by`, and `subline_by` features introduced in rtflite 1.0.0, 
we can efficiently create paginated TLFs. 
([examples](https://pharmaverse.github.io/rtflite/articles/advanced-group-by/#multi-page-example-with-group-context))

### Figure Embedding

With the `RTFFigure` feature introduced in rtflite 1.0.0, 
we can embed multiple figures with titles, footnotes, and data sources. 
([examples](https://pharmaverse.github.io/rtflite/articles/example-figure/))

### Table Combination 

`RTFDocument` now supports a listing of tables that allows 
users to combine multiple tables to create advanced layouts.
